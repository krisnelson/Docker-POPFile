# Docker-POPFile
An unofficial docker container for POPFile (on Alpine) 1.1.3 [NOT 
FUNCTIONAL YET]

**WARNING:** Right now this just installs the prerequisites for POPFile 
and then starts POPFile.pl (as root in the container). It does not yet 
have save a configuration file, save messages, or do anything, really.

## POPFile
POPFile automatically sorts your email messages and fights spam. See:
